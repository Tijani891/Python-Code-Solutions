## Python Coding Solutions

Welcome to the **Python Coding** challenge! This repository contains the code and resources I've worked on during my 100-day journey to improve my Python programming skills.


## About

The **100 Days of Python Coding** challenge is a self-imposed challenge where I committed to coding in Python every day for 100 days. The purpose of this challenge is to improve my problem-solving skills, learn new Python concepts, and apply them in various projects and exercises.

## Goals

- Strengthen my understanding of Python fundamentals.
- Work on a variety of coding problems and projects.
- Explore libraries and frameworks in Python.
- Document my learning and progress.
- Build a portfolio of Python projects.

## Structure

The repository is organized into directories for each day, where each directory contains the code and notes for that day's challenge.

```
.
├── Day 01
│   └── main.py
├── Day 02
│   └── main.py
├── Day 03
│   └── main.py
└── ...
```

### Day Directories

- **README.md**: Each day's directory contains a `README.md` file describing the task or problem for the day, along with any relevant notes or explanations.
- **main.py**: The main Python file containing the solution or project code for the day.
